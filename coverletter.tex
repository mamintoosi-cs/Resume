\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a member of Mathematics department at Hakim Sabzevari University from 1999 until now. My main research interests lie in the areas of Computer Vision and Combinatorial Optimization.

I received my BSc degree in Mathematics  in 1994 and my M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering  with a second class honors, in 1998 from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (the largest university in the east of IRAN). My M.Sc. thesis about \textbf{Tiling Problem} was under supervision of Dr. Reza Monsefi, associate Professor of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. 

From 1998 I joined to Mathematics department of Hakim Sabzevari University as a lecturer. 

At 2006, I started my PhD curriculum in Artificial Intelligence at Iran University of Science and Technology under supervision of Dr. Mahmood Fathy (professor of CE department, IUST) and Dr. Nasser Mozayani (associate professor of CE department, IUST). I graduated on 2011 and returned back to Sabzevar.

I thought several courses including programming, machine learning, combinatorial optimization and many other computer courses.

\lettersection{Why SUTD?}
Singapore University of Technology and Design is one of the leading universities in the world, which tries to put science into action. Working at SUTD is a great experience for every researcher.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
One of the current projects running in SUTD is robotic vacuum cleaner. \emph{Tiling Problem}, which I worked on it, is  related to this project. According to my experience on this problem, I believe that I will have a good cooperation with the project team.
